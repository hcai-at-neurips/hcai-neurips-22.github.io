                        <p>Many institutions, researchers, and thought leaders have recently promoted the notion that AI
                            systems should be human-centered. Although there is no consensus definition for what
                            human-centered AI means, it commonly refers to a set of principles that AI systems ought to
                            be (a) reliable, safe, and trustworthy; (b) relatively free from bias and not promote or
                            reinforce existing structural inequalities; (c) empowering people by supporting their
                            creativity and (d) fit-for-purpose for use by specific humans, or groups of humans, to meet
                            human needs and self-efficacy.</p>
                        <p>Following a successful workshop in 2021, our 2022 virtual workshop aims to bring people
                            together across different communities that have a stake in HCAI. Broadly, these communities
                            encompass researchers and practitioners working across AI, machine learning, and
                            human-computer interaction (HCI). However, many disconnected sub-communities exist that work
                            across various. important topics in HCAI, including: human-centered explainable AI (XAI), AI
                            Fairness, human-centered data science (HCDS), human-centered machine learning, computational
                            creativity, and human-AI co-creation.</p>
                        <p>Building on the 2021 workshop, we will explore topics such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Processes, principles, and technologies to make AI systems more human-centered.</li>
                            <li>Experimental design and data collection to strengthen HCAI studies.</li>
                            <li>Explanations (XAI) that serve the needs of diverse end-users.</li>
                            <li>Human-AI frameworks for analyzing, designing, and evaluating HCAI systems.</li>
                            <li>Collaboration and (co-)creativity in HCAI systems.</li>
                            <li>Emergent questions in ethics and fairness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Themes </h2>
                        <p>Submissions to the workshop may address one or more of the following themes - or other
                            relevant themes of interest:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Theoretical frameworks, disciplines and disciplinarity.</strong> How we approach
                                AI and data science depends on the "lenses" that we bring, based in theory and in
                                practice. Through what perspectives do you approach this complex domain?</li>
                            <li><strong>Experiences and cases with AI systems.</strong> Theories suggest studies and
                                experience reports. Studies and experience reports inform theories. What cases or
                                experiences of human-AI interactions can you contribute to our inter-disciplinary
                                knowledge and discussion?</li>
                            <li><strong>Design frameworks for human initiative and AI initiative.</strong> Scholars have
                                debated the question of who should have initiative or control between human and AI for
                                over 70 years. What forms of discrete or shared initiative are possible now, and how can
                                we include these possibilities in our systems?</li>
                            <li><strong>Experiences and cases with human-AI collaboration.</strong> Design frameworks
                                can inform applications. Experiences with applications can challenge frameworks, or lead
                                to new frameworks. What cases or experiences of human-AI collaborations can you
                                contribute to our inter-disciplinary knowledge and discussion?</li>
                            <li><strong>Fairness and bias.</strong> Machine learning-based decision-making systems have
                                the potential to replicate or even exacerbate social inequeties and discrimination. As a
                                result, there is a surge of recent work on developing machine learning algorithms with
                                fairness constraints or guarantees. However, for these tools to have positive real-world
                                impact, their design and implementation should be informed by a clear understanding of
                                human behavior and real needs. What is the interplay between algorithmic fairness and
                                HCI?</li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy.</strong> In many important machine learning tasks – e.g. those related
                                to healthcare – there is much to be gained from training on personal information, but we
                                must take care to respect individuals’ privacy appropriately. In this workshop, we are
                                particularly interested in understanding specific use cases and considering costs and
                                benefits to individuals and society of making use of private data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparency, explainability, interpretability, and trust.</strong> We are
                                interested to understand what specific types of explainability or interpretability are
                                helpful to whom in concrete settings, and in exploring any tradeoffs which are
                                inevitably faced.</li>
                            <li><strong>User research.</strong> What do we need to know in order to create or enhance an
                                AI-based system? Our engineering heritage suggests that we seek user needs and resolve
                                user pain points. How does our user research for these concepts change with AI systems?
                                Are there other user research goals that are now possible with more sophisticated AI
                                resources and implementations?</li>
                            <li><strong>Accountability.</strong> When people engineer (or create) an AI system and its
                                data, how do we hold them and ourselves accountable for design decisions and outcomes?
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Automation of AI.</strong> It is tempting to apply AI to AI, in the form of
                                automated AI. Is this a credible approach? Does human discernment play a role in
                                creating AI systems? Is this a necessary role?</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluation.</strong> What are the appropriate measurement concepts and resulting
                                metrics to assess our AI systems? How do we balance among efficiency, explainability,
                                understandability, user satisfaction, and user hedonics?</li>
                            <li><strong>Governance.</strong> Consequential machine learning systems impact the lives of
                                millions of people in areas such as criminal justice, healthcare, education, credit
                                scoring or hiring. Key concepts in the governance of such systems include algorithmic
                                discrimination, transparency, veracity, explainability and the preservation of privacy.
                                What is the role of HCI in relation to the governance of such systems?</li>
                            <li><strong>Problematizing data.</strong> Data initially seem to be simple and ”objective.”
                                However, a growing body of evidence shows the often-hidden role of humans in shaping the
                                data in AI. Should we design our systems to strengthen human engagement with data? or to
                                reduce human impact on data?</li>
                            <li><strong>Qualitative data in data science.</strong> Quantitative data analyses may be
                                powerful, but often decontextualized and potentially shallow. Qualitative data analyses
                                may be insightful, but often limited to a narrow sample. How can we combine the
                                strengths of these two approaches? </li>
                            <li><strong>Values and ethics of AI.</strong> Values and ethics are necessarily entangled
                                with localized, situated, and culturally-informed human perspectives. What are useful
                                frameworks for a comparative analysis of values and ethics in AI?</li>
                        </ul>
